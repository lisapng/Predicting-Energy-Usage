# eSC Predicting Energy Project

## Project Description
I have been hired by a fictional energy company (eSC). eSC provides electricity (power) to residential properties in South Carolina (and a small part of North Carolina). eSC is concerned about global warming, Mainly, the impact of global warming increasing the demand for their electricity. In short, they are worried that next summer will put too much demand on their electrical grid (ex. their ability to supply electricity to their customers when they want to cool their homes). Since they are focused on the summer, eSC is focused on July energy usage. July was selected, as eSC believes July is typically the highest energy usage month.

## Project Implementation 
Hosts an R project that investigates July energy usage trends and patterns, I aim to equip eSC with the knowledge necessary to enhance grid reliability, mitigate risks, and uphold their commitment to delivering uninterrupted power services to their clientele.
